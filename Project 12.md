However, some improvement will be made to the code.The ansible code will be refractored, assignments wull be created and impoerts functionality will also be explpored.Imports allow to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook â€“ it allows to organize your tasks and reuse them when needed.

## Jenkins Job Enhancement
Because artifacts on the Jenkins server change directory with each build. To maintain track of current artefacts, the copy-artifacts plugin is used to copy recent artifacts from a build and automatically paste them to a defined directory where ansible playbooks may be easily launched.

* Create a new directory in the ansible-jenkins server  called ansible-config-artifact. artifacts will be stored there after each build.
* Change permissions to this directory, so Jenkins could save files there
