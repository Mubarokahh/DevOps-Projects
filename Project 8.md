## LOAD BALANCER SOLUTION WITH APACHE


After completing Project-7 you might wonder how a user will be accessing each of the webservers using 3 different IP address or 3 different DNS names. You might also wonder what is the point of having 3 different servers doing exactly the same thing.

When we access a website in the Internet we use an URL and we do not really know how many servers are out there serving our requests, this complexity is hidden from a regular user, but in case of websites that are being visited by millions of users per day (like Google or Reddit) it is impossible to serve all the users from a single Web Server (it is also applicable to databases, but for now we will not focus on distributed DBs)

Each URL contains a domain name part, which is translated (resolved) to IP address of a target server that will serve requests when open a website in the Internet. Translation (resolution) of domain names is perormed by DNS servers, the most commonly used one has a public IP address 8.8.8.8 and belongs to Google. You can try to query it with nslookup command:

`nslookup 8.8.8.8
Server:  UnKnown
Address:  103.86.99.99

Name:    dns.google
Address:  8.8.8.8`
